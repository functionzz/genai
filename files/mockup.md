### Summary

Each of these images illustrates a part of the Guru App’s user journey:
- **Principal Screen** for welcoming and orienting users.
- **Chat Screens** (`chat.jpg`, `chat2.jpg`, `chat3.jpg`) showing conversational AI with contextual responses and embedded charts.
- **Analysis.jpg** for dashboard style visual overviews.
