This script is a Flask application. Below are the instructions to set up the environment, install dependencies, and run the application:

1. Install Pipenv:
    Ensure you have Pipenv installed. If not, you can install it using pip:
    ```
    pip install pipenv
    ```

2. Install Dependencies:
    Navigate to the directory containing the `Pipfile` and run the following command to install the required dependencies:
    ```
    pipenv install
    ```

3. Activate the Virtual Environment:
    Activate the Pipenv virtual environment by running:
    ```
    pipenv shell
    ```

4. Run the Flask Application:
    Once inside the virtual environment, you can start the Flask application by running:
    ```
    flask run
    ```

    By default, the application will be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

5. Additional Notes:
    - Ensure that the `FLASK_APP` environment variable is set to the name of the script (e.g., `export FLASK_APP=app.py` if the script is named `app.py`).
    - For development mode with auto-reloading, you can enable the development server by setting the `FLASK_ENV` environment variable to `development`:
      ```
      export FLASK_ENV=development
      ```
